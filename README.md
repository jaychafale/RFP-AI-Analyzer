# üöÄ **RFP-AI Analyzer**

Automating Government RFP Analysis using Generative AI, RAG & Agentic Workflows

## **Problem Statement**

The current RFP review process is manual, time-consuming, and high-risk.
- ‚åõ Takes hours to days to review a single RFP
- ‚ùå Prone to missing deal-breaker clauses
- ‚öñÔ∏è Difficult to identify biased terms or eligibility gaps
- üîÅ Repetitive for every new RFP
- ü§Ø No central intelligence or analytics
